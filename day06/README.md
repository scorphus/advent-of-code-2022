## \--- Day 6: Tuning Trouble ---

The preparations are finally complete; you and the Elves leave camp on foot and
begin to make your way toward the _star_ fruit grove.

As you move through the dense undergrowth, one of the Elves gives you a handheld
_device_. He says that it has many fancy features, but the most important one to
set up right now is the _communication system_.

However, because he's heard you have

[signal-based](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/16)
[systems](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25), he convinced the other Elves
that it would be okay to give you their one malfunctioning device
- surely you'll have no problem fixing it.

As if inspired by comedic timing, the device emits a few colorful sparks.

To be able to communicate with the Elves, the device needs to _lock on to their
signal_. The signal is a series of seemingly-random characters that the device
receives one at a time.

To fix the communication system, you need to add a subroutine to the device that
detects a _start-of-packet marker_ in the datastream. In the protocol being used
by the Elves, the start of a packet is indicated by a sequence of _four
characters that are all different_.

The device will send your subroutine a datastream buffer (your puzzle input);
your subroutine needs to identify the first position where the four most
recently received characters were all different. Specifically, it needs to
report the number of characters from the beginning of the buffer to the end of
the first such four-character marker.

For example, suppose you receive the following datastream buffer:

    mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb

After the first three characters (`mjq`) have been received, there haven't been
enough characters received yet to find the marker. The first time a marker could
occur is after the fourth character is received, making the most recent four
characters `mjqj`. Because `j` is repeated, this isn't a marker.

The first time a marker appears is after the _seventh_ character arrives. Once
it does, the last four characters received are `jpqm`, which are all different.
In this case, your subroutine should report the value _`7`_, because the first
start-of-packet marker is complete after 7 characters have been processed.

Here are a few more examples:

-   `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`: first marker after character _`5`_
-   `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`: first marker after character _`6`_
-   `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg`: first marker after character _`10`_
-   `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`: first marker after character _`11`_

_How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-packet
marker is detected?_

Your puzzle answer was `1850`.

## \--- Part Two ---

Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still
isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for _messages_.

A _start-of-message marker_ is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it
consists of _14 distinct characters_ rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above
examples:

-   `mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb`: first marker after character _`19`_
-   `bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz`: first marker after character _`23`_
-   `nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg`: first marker after character _`23`_
-   `nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg`: first marker after character _`29`_
-   `zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw`: first marker after character _`26`_

_How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message
marker is detected?_

Your puzzle answer was `2823`.
